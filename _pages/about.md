I’m Vipin Kumar, a Senior Android Developer with 8 years of experience in building scalable and high-performance Android apps.
I specialize in Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and modern architecture patterns like MVVM and MVI.
Currently, I’ve been leading feature development and architecture improvements at Rapido and MoEngage.
I’ve worked extensively with Room, Coroutines, Flow, Hilt, and Clean Architecture principles.
My experience spans both SDK and app development for B2B and B2C use cases.
I enjoy crafting clean, maintainable code with a strong focus on user experience and performance.
I’ve published multiple apps on the Play Store, including Rapido Captain, Revu, and IpatientD.
Open to remote or hybrid roles in the Delhi NCR region.
Outside of work, I explore new tech stacks and build open-source side projects.
I’m available to join immediately and always eager to contribute to impactful mobile products.
